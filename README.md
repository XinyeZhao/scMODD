# scMODD

#### **s**ingls-**c**ell **MO**del-driven **D**oublet **D**etection(**scMODD**) a model-driven algorithm to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data.
- _**scMODO_with_combined_features.ipynb**_ contains the scripts of scMODD using combined features from scDblfinder
- _**doublet_dominated_cluster_detection.ipynb**_ contains the scripts of detecting doublet-dominated clusters using DBSCAN and Leiden
- _**doublet_simulator.ipynb**_ contains the scripts of simulating artificial doublets
- Please refer to the _**main.py**_ file for an example of using scMODD on the demo data.
